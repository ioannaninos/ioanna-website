  <p> With the rise of technology and science-fiction horror films, some people may fear  the  day  that  robots  take  over  the  world. While  this  is  an  unrealistic  scenario at  the  moment,  it  is  possible  for machines and  artificial  intelligence  to  fill  human positions, causing these jobs to be “automated away.” Ultimately, there is no need to worry about this, because machines will not be able to completely take over all human jobs.
  </p>
  <p>  To begin with, automated jobs actually increase the need for more humans to fill non-automated jobs. A video posted on YouTube by CGP Grey titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU\
"> “Humans Need Not Apply” </a> looks at replacement by automation in different parts, such as horses, creative work, and low-skill manufacturing jobs. What the video fails to mention is how even though employing a robot to do a human’s work does save time and money, increased production will bring about a need for an increase in production for the non-automated jobs related to it. For example, if more machines are being used in a factory to create parts for a product, then the factory will need more human workers to overlook and run the machines. Even though they are becoming more and more advanced, humans programming robots can still make mistake. In a special report on  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2016/06/25/automation-and-anxiety
"> “Automation and Anxiety” </a> published in The Economist ITALICs, it is revealed that smarter machines will not necessarily put Americans out of work. While it is true that some professions will likely become automated within the next few years, there are some jobs that are best done by actual people. Take, for example, therapists. Robots can not simply be programmed to feel empathy in their social interactions,  so they cannot fill the job properly. As Robert D. Atkinson and John Wu of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation say in Forbes’ article titled <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2017/05/15/why-robots-wont-be-coming-for-all-our-jobs/#2fc89091287b
">“Why Robots Won’t Be Coming For All Our Jobs,” </a>pessimists “often assume that robots can do most jobs, when in fact they can’t, or that once a job is lost there are no second-order job-creating effects from increased productivity and spending.” Essentially, there will still be jobs for humans to fill, so there is no need to fret about it all.

  </p>
  <p> In summation, humans should not worry about their jobs being taken over by robots and automated machines. With a greater need for jobs that cannot be automated, there will always be a safe place for humans to work.
