  <h2> Ethical Reflection 2: Ad Dystopia <h2>

<div id="writing">
  <p> July 16th, 2018 </p>
  <p> As we live in the height of the age of social media, people are constantly sharing and posting about themselves online using websites like an Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat– applications that are free to its users, but still make money through advertising separate companies to their consumers. In order to ensure maximum profit, algorithms are used to gather information to about consumers and to match ads to the right audience. I believe that this process of matching ads to a certain group of viewers is perfectly fine. Though some people may argue that data-mining deducts their privacy, they willingly volunteer their information when creating their accounts and posting statuses, so companies should not be blamed for collecting and storing what is being put out on the internet. Participating in social media is a conscious decision, and if privacy is a concern, accounts can always be deleted.
  </p>
  <p>  Each time you click on a YouTube video or scroll through your Instagram feed, it is likely that you will come across an ad that catches your eye. It could be because of the brand being advertised, or the design of the promotion itself. Stumbling across the ad was no coincidence– based on your previous browsing history, age, gender, and other factors, an algorithm displayed it due to its content and what the computer already knows about you<a href="  http://fortune.com/2018/03/21/facebook-personal-data-cambridge-analytica/"> (1).</a> Making the perfect match is important to online websites and services because if the advertising company makes money, then so does the platform that displays it. Companies are constantly trying to catch the attention of the viewer, and they use the personal data that they have access to in order to target profitable people<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW0eUrUiyxo"> (2).</a> Unfortunately, as stated by Zeynep Tufekci in her TED Talk titled "We're building a dystopia just to make people click on ads," humans do not understand how exactly these computer programs are working, meaning that the programmer does not have complete control over the system <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads">(3).</a> Nearly anyone can pay for their own ad to be put out on the internet, and they can even specify their target audience. However, ads are not thoroughly reviewed by people, making it easy for anyone to pay a small amount to display their message to the world. In an article published by ProPublica titled "Facebook Enable Advertisers to Reach 'Jew Haters,' " the writers walk the reader through the process of purchasing an ad on Facebook and how to reach their target audience. The advertisement published by the company was programmed to reach “jew haters” and there was a surprising amount of audiences related to the topic. After spending $30, the reporters published 3 ads for two days and reached 5,897 different people <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters"> (4).</a> Ultimately, the matched ads result in a customized experience for consumers. I have personally discovered several brands through ads that show up on my Instagram, including skin-care products and clothing brands that I have purchased. If the app had not used my personal data, I wouldn’t have learned about the products, and I could’ve been shown ads irrelevant to my personal life, like Foreman grills or injury attorneys. Additionally, the ads are a part of a free service that I use often. If the company wasn’t making money from advertisements, I would probably have to pay a fee every month to use Instagram. Overall, the sharing of user data isn’t as bad as some people make it out to be.
  </p>
  <p> To conclude, companies are constantly gathering data about their consumers to use for ad placement, which benefits everyone involved. Users receive a free personalized experience, companies putting out advertisements make money when users see their ad and buy something, and the websites matching ads to consumers make money.
