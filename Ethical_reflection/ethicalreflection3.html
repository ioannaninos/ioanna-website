  <h2> Ethical Reflection 3: Net Neutrality <h2>
</div>
<div id="writing">
  <p> July 20th, 2018 </p>
  <p> For decades, the Internet has served many purposes. Nearly 90% of American households have a computer, Net neutrality is the principle that allows anyone to go online to view and post whatever they would like to, without needing to pay any fees to companies like Comcast and AT&T. Net neutrality is quintessential in a country that prides freedom so strongly-- it is only appropriate that we have our own freedom when browsing the web. The principle is important because it allows groups that may be blocked out by companies to have a voice. Small businesses need their websites to grow, and people of color have often used the web as a method of reaching out to others for activism. I believe that this principle should never have been repealed, and Congress should use their power to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's vote. Accordingly, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be regulated by the government so that customers are not overcharged.
  </p>
  <p>  To begin with, net neutrality is crucial for communities of color and small businesses. People of color use the internet as a place to share their personal stories and spread awareness about racial issues in the world. As a resource that most people have access to, the web is also used by POCs to organize rallies and other events to promote racial justice. Without net neutrality, websites reserve the right to block their content, contributing to the underrepresentation of people of color in media and on the World Wide Web. As explained in the article <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennyodegard/2017/12/04/what-net-neutrality-changes-could-mean-for-your-small-business/#362f030156a1"> “Net Neutrality: What You Need to Know Now”</a> published on Free Press, media-ownership lacks diversity, which is another factor affecting these communities of color. In addition to this, net neutrality helps small businesses grow and advertise their brands. Without the principle, there will no longer be a level playing field for these businesses as ISPs may block them and promote larger businesses. In a Forbes article titled <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennyodegard/2017/12/04/what-net-neutrality-changes-could-mean-for-your-small-business/#362f030156a1"> “What Net Neutrality Changes Could Mean For Your Small Business,” </a> author Jenny Odegard explains how the policy will be detrimental. For example, customers may associate negative experiences with the business if the page is not loading as quickly as websites for competitors. Overall, this makes it difficult for smaller businesses to compete with bigger name brands. While lesser-known companies may not be accessed as easily without net neutrality, it is possible that some major sites may not be accessed at all. As Dominic Girard explains on IRL’s podcast <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennyodegard/2017/12/04/what-net-neutrality-changes-could-mean-for-your-small-business/#362f030156a1" > “The Neutral Zone: The Future of Net Neutrality,” </a> Europe has previously attempted having ISPs controlling the Internet, and it did not work out too well to say the least. The United States should learn from Europe’s experiences and reinstate the policy to facilitate the lives of Internet users. Girard describes the chaos that ensued the continent’s attempt as consumers tried to switch amongst Internet service providers due to the increased amount of network traffic and Skype being blocked.  Internet service providers should be regulated so that they cannot change the loading speeds of certain websites or charge extra fees to view certain web pages.

  </p>
  <p> To conclude, the termination of net neutrality will bring about various changes in the way that Americans access websites and services online. The policy allowed for people of color to have a voice and communicate amongst their communities without being any restrictions, and it also ensured that all sites would be accessible, despite their content or reputation. Internet service providers should be regulated by the government to assure that they provide reasonable access speeds and sites.
